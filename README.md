# IE-Schematics
A collection of [Schematica](http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/225603-schematica) schematics for [Immersive Engineering](http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/231951-immersive-engineering) and [Immersive Integration](http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/232159-immersive-integration) multi-block machines.

The **Refinery** changed in IE 0.6, schematics for both versions are included.

If you use Schematica printing mode, you need to fix the orientation of the Structural Arms for the **Assembler** and the orientation of the conveyor belts for the **Bottling Machine** (the **Assembler** doesn't care about those).
